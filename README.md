# VBA-challenge
This homework uses VBA scripting to analyze three years of stock market data.

The script loops through all stocks for one year and outputs the ticker symbol, the yearly change from opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of the year, and the total volume of the stock. 

Conditional formatting shows positive changes in green and negatives changes in red.

A seperate table shows stocks with the Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease, and Greatest Total Stock Volume for the year. 

The script then loops through all worksheets in the file.
